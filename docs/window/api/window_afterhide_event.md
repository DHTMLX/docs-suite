# afterHide

@short: fires after a window is hidden

@signature: {'afterHide: (position: object, events?: Event) => void;'}

@params:
- `position: object` - an object with coordinates of the window's position. The parameter contains two attributes:
    - `left: number` - the left coordinate of the window's position (in pixels)
    - `top: number` - the top coordinate of the window's position (in pixels)
- `events: Event` - a native event object

@example:
dhxWindow.events.on("afterHide", function(position, events){
    console.log("A window is hidden", events);
});

@descr:

**Related sample**: [Window. Events](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/jfu4upwd)

Note, the event fires in 2 cases:

1. While calling the [](window/api/window_hide_method.md) method.
2. While the [closable](window/api/window_closable_config.md) option is enabled and a user clicks on the Close icon. When the user closes the window by clicking on the Close icon, the native event object will be passed into the second argument.

@changelog:

The **position** and **events** parameters have been added in v7.0.
