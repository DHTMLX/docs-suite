# Work with Ribbon

## Setting/getting values and states

You can change the value or state (for a TwoState button) of a control with the help of the [setState()](ribbon/api/ribbon_setstate_method.md) method. It takes one parameter: a *key-value* pair with the ID of the control and its new value (state).

This is how you can set the state of a twoState button:

~~~js
{ type:"button", twoState:true, id:"check" }
...
ribbon.setState({"check":true});
ribbon.setState({"check":false});
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Set state](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/i7kabram)

And this is how you can change the value of an input:

~~~js
{ type:"input", id: "file_name" }
...
ribbon.setState({"file_name":"My file"});
~~~

To get the current value of the control, use the [getState()](ribbon/api/ribbon_getstate_method.md) method. 

This is what the method returns for a TwoState button:

~~~js
{ type:"button", twoState:true, id:"check" }
...
ribbon.getState();
// { check:true }
// or
// { check:false }
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Get state](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/coei9fys)

And this is how you can get the current value of an input:

~~~js
{ type:"input", id:"file_name", value:"My file" }
...
ribbon.getState();

// {"file_name":"My file"}
~~~

## Hiding and showing controls

You can show or hide controls by their IDs. Pass them to the corresponding methods - [show()](ribbon/api/ribbon_show_method.md) and [hide()](ribbon/api/ribbon_hide_method.md):

~~~js
ribbon.hide("add_btn");
ribbon.show(["save_btn","del_btn"]);
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Show/hide Ribbon item](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/1jkf7954)

Starting from v7.0, it is possible to hide/show all Ribbon controls on the page at once by using the methods without parameters:

~~~js
// hides all Ribbon controls
ribbon.hide();
// shows all Ribbon controls
ribbon.show();
~~~

## Disabling and enabling controls

You can disable or enable controls. The related methods - [enable()](ribbon/api/ribbon_enable_method.md) and [disable()](ribbon/api/ribbon_disable_method.md) - take the IDs of controls as parameters:

~~~js
ribbon.disable("add_btn");
ribbon.enable(["save_btn","del_btn"]);
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Enable / disable Ribbon item](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/l3f8pq2g)

Starting from v7.0, it is possible to disable/enable all Ribbon controls on the page at once by using the methods without parameters:

~~~js
// disables all Ribbon controls
ribbon.disable();
// enables all Ribbon controls
ribbon.enable();
~~~

## Checking if a Ribbon item is disabled

To check if an item of Ribbon is disabled, call the [isDisabled()](ribbon/api/ribbon_isdisabled_method.md) method. The method takes one parameter:

<table>
	<tbody>
        <tr>
			<td><b>id</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string, number</i>) an id of an item</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

~~~js
ribbon.isDisabled("1"); // -> true/false
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Enable / disable Ribbon item](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/l3f8pq2g)

## Selecting/Unselecting an item

### Selecting a ribbon item

To select a particular Ribbon item, make use of the [select()](ribbon/api/ribbon_select_method.md) method of Ribbon. The method takes two parameters:

<table>
	<tbody>
        <tr>
			<td><b>id</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string, number</i>) an id of an item</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td><b>unselect</b></td>
			<td>(<i>boolean</i>) optional, <i>true</i> - to unselect previously selected items, otherwise - <i>false</i>; <i>true</i> by default</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

~~~js
ribbon.select("print");
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Select / unselect](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/0vy8uk4s)

### Unselecting a ribbon item

To remove selection from a selected item, apply the [unselect()](ribbon/api/ribbon_unselect_method.md) method of Ribbon. The method may take the id of an item as a parameter:

~~~js
// unselects a specified selected item
ribbon.unselect("print");
~~~

It is also possible to remove selection from all previously selected items of Ribbon via the [unselect()](ribbon/api/ribbon_unselect_method.md) method:

~~~js
// unselects all previously selected items
ribbon.unselect();
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Select / unselect](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/0vy8uk4s)

## Checking if a ribbon item is selected

To check if an item of Ribbon is selected, call the [isSelected()](ribbon/api/ribbon_isselected_method.md) method. The method takes one parameter:

<table>
	<tbody>
        <tr>
			<td><b>id</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string, number</i>) an id of a ribbon item</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

~~~js
ribbon.isSelected("print"); // -> returns true/false
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Select / unselect](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/0vy8uk4s)

## Getting selected items

To get the selected items, call the [getSelected()](ribbon/api/ribbon_getselected_method.md) method. The method returns an array of IDs of selected items:

~~~js
ribbon.getSelected(); // -> ["selected_1", "selected_1.1"]
~~~

## Using Tree collection API

### Adding controls

You can add controls dynamically with the **add()** method of [TreeCollection](tree_collection.md).

~~~js
ribbon.data.add({
    type:"button",
    icon:"dxi-plus",
    value:"New"
},-1,"blockId");
~~~

**Related sample**: [Ribbon. Add item](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/bphk7h9u)

This is how you can add a block of controls:

~~~js
ribbon.data.add({
    label:"File",
    type:"block",
    id:"files",
    direction:"row",
	items: [
		{
			icon: "dxi dxi-undo",
			size: "small",
			ribbonHeight: "double"
		},
		{
			icon: "dxi dxi-redo",
			size: "small",
			ribbonHeight: "double"
		}
	]
});
~~~

### Getting controls by IDs

You can get a particular Ribbon control by its ID via the **getItem()** method:

~~~js
const add_btn = ribbon.data.getItem("add_btn");
~~~

To get the ID of the parent of the control, call the **getParent()** method:

~~~js
const parentId = ribbon.data.getParent("add_btn");
~~~

You can also access the children of a control with the **getItems()** method:

~~~js
const items = ribbon.data.getItems("block1");
~~~

You can use the **getLength()** method of TreeCollection to count children of a control:

~~~js
ribbon.data.getLength("block1");
~~~

### Iterating through controls

You can work with all (or some) Ribbon controls with the help of the **forEach()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.forEach(function(item){
    // remove all icons
    item.icon = "";
});
ribbon.paint();
~~~

### Iterating through children

To iterate through all controls in a particular block, pass one more parameter to **forEach()** - the ID of the block:

~~~js
ribbon.data.forEach(function(item){
    // remove all icons
    item.icon = "";
},"bl_1");
ribbon.paint();
~~~

If you want to iterate only through immediate children, pass a third parameter - *1*:

~~~js
ribbon.data.forEach(function(item){
    // remove all icons
    item.icon = "";
}, "bl_1", 1);
ribbon.paint();
~~~

Iterating through children is also can be done with the **eachChild()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.eachChild("bl_1",function(item){
    // remove all icons
    item.icon = "";
});
ribbon.paint();
~~~

To access only the immediate children, add the **direct** parameter and set it to _false_:

~~~js
ribbon.data.eachChild("bl_1", function(item){
    // remove all icons
    item.icon = "";
},false);
ribbon.paint();
~~~

To check whether an item has childs, use the **haveItems()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.haveItems("block1");
// -> true
~~~

### Iterating through parents

To iterate through all the parent items (the immediate parent and its parent, etc. until the parent is the ribbon itself), use the **eachParent()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.eachParent("new_btn",function(item){
	console.log(item)
});
~~~

### Rearranging Ribbon controls

You can move Ribbon items to different positions with the **move()** method of TreeCollection. For example, this is how you can move a block with ID "bl_2" to the right edge of the Ribbon:

~~~js
ribbon.data.move("bl_2",-1);
~~~

{{note
The ID should always be a string, even if in the configuration of control you've set it as a number.
}}

To get the current position of a block, use the **getIndex()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.getIndex("bl_2");
~~~

### Making copies of controls

You can add a copy of a control and place it in the specified position on the ribbon with the **copy()** method of TreeCollection:

~~~js
ribbon.data.copy("block1",2);
~~~

You can copy a control into a block of the same ribbon:

~~~js
ribbon.data.copy("save_btn",1,ribbon.data,"block2");
~~~

You can also copy a control and place it into another ribbon:

~~~js
ribbon1.data.copy("save_btn",1,ribbon2.data,"block3");
~~~

### Clearing Ribbon

To remove all controls from Ribbon, users should call the **removeAll()** method of TreeCollection. Afterwards, you can load other items.

~~~js
ribbon.data.removeAll();
ribbon.data.parse(new_controls);
~~~
