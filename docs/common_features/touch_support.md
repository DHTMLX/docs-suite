# Touch support

Since version 7.0 and upper, the dhtmlxSuite library provides the built-in Touch support that should work out of the box. As a result, the interaction with the DHTMLX-based apps on touch devices becomes more comfy and predictable. 

{{note Check the <a href="https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/q3cu6x1a"  target="_blank">example in our Snippet Tool</a> to try out the functionality on your touch devices.}}

While interacting with applications by touching the screen, a tap becomes the same thing as a mouse click.
Thus, the click events (fire on clicking, double clicking an item) will continue working on touch-screen devices. But note, that the mouseover events will not trigger.

Touch support works for all DHTMLX widgets and enables recognition for the following touch gestures:

- **Double Tap** - to edit items
- **Press and Hold** - to call the context menu
- **Drag** - to resize and reorder items, to change the value in Slider, ColorPicker, or TimePicker
