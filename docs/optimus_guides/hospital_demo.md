## Demo overview

The hospital management system demo is a complex solution to show you how DHTMLX widgets can be organized and what components they have on board. You can use the demo to build your management system easily.

Pay attention to how the Patient Registration Form is realized. Here you can find built-in Datepicker, Combobox, Input fields, RadioGroup controls, and even more.

Treegrid is the main widget of the demo. With the help of it, you can manage the hospital in real-time. Tabbar helps you to organize the information in the Treegrid in a convenient way.
