## Demo overview

The UI dashboard demo shows you how to build comprehensive dashboards for enterprise software and other web apps. This is an example of a CRM system based on DHTMLX widgets. DHTMLX Gantt and DHTMLX Scheduler are also parts of the demo. The demo is interactive – check how it works. You can add new tickets, change the schedule, and manipulate the Gantt diagram.

The UI dashboard demo is made with the help of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

There are no specific backend requirements. The demo is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
