## Demo overview

The file manager demo is a handy way to work with files of any size. You can easily integrate the demo into your project and modify it according to your needs.

The file manager demo is built on the base of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

There are no specific backend requirements. The demo is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
