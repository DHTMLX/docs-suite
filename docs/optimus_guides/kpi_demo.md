This demo application shows how to create a Sales KPI tracking system based on the DHTMLX Suite widgets: Layout, List, Toolbar, and Charts.

## How to download

Open the [KPI Tracking System](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/demoApps/dhtmlxKPI/) demo and click the Download Demo button in the bottom right corner of the page.

Complete the form to start the download. The email with the download link will be sent to you.

Follow the link in the email to get a free 30-day trial version. You will receive a .zip file with the KPI tracking system demo. Save the file and unpack it into your working directory.

You will find more demos on the [DHTMLX JavaScript Demos](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/demoApps/) page. To view the desired one, just click on it.

## How to start

To run the demo, follow the instructions in the README.md file.

## Demo overview

DHTMLX Chart from the Suite package is the core component of the demo. It provides various types of charts for visualizing complex data. The KPI tracking system is an interactive demo. You can change the parameters and see the results immediately.

The KPI demo is built with the help of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

The solution you can see has no requirements for the backend. It is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
