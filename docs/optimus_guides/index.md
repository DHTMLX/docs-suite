# DHTMLX Optimus framework

DHTMLX Optimus is a component-oriented framework for building DHTMLX-based apps. The framework is intended to simplify the app building process, namely:

- helps to organize application code in a single, structured, intuitive style;
- provides tools for exchanging data and events between application parts and an external environment (server, external services, etc.); 
- can automatically adjust the life cycle of components of the app (for example, free up the unused memory and so on).

The framework enforces consistent application structure by breaking a monolithic application into a set of reusable classes. 
As a result, each part of an app can be developed and tested independently and used in various combinations.

DHTMLX Optimus is a fully client-side solution. There aren't any special requirements to the server. You can use any data REST backend (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.)

General idea
------------

DHTMLX Optimus is based on the modern approaches of web development:

- ES6 classes and JavaScript modules;
- dividing the application into Views;
- data transfer and the life cycle of a View 

Each module describes a part of UI (a single view). You can use normal DHTMLX code inside of the module to initialize a single component. 
Top level modules can combine multiple views. The app itself can be used as a view. 

The framework provides a common event bus to allow communication between the views and some other helpers for common DHTMLX tasks.

How to start
-----------

The best way to start working with the DHTMLX Optimus framework is to create a simple application. 

### Running the environment 

To begin with, you should configure the environment for your project. 

You can use a ready project with configured settings from <a href="https://github.com/DHTMLX/optimus-starter-app/tree/main" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. To run the project on the local server, use:

~~~js
npm install
npm start
~~~

<br>

*In other cases*, DHTMLX Optimus can be added into your own project via the `npm` package manager. For that, run the following commands in your project directory:

- to install "dhx-optimus":

~~~js
npm i dhx-optimus
~~~

- to install the "dhx-optimus-store" state manager:

~~~js
npm i dhx-optimus-store
~~~

{{note DHTMLX Optimus requires the files of the DHTMLX Suite library as dependencies. Thus, you'll need to add js/css files of DHTMLX Suite to provide the correct work of DHTMLX Optimus.}}


### Creating an application

After running the <a href="https://github.com/DHTMLX/optimus-starter-app/tree/main" target="_blank">project</a> on the local server and opening *http://localhost:8080/* in your browser, you will see the following result:

![](../assets/optimus/start_optimus.png)

Let's consider how we've created our demo application:

1\. First, we've created a new *index.html* file in the *src* folder and defined a container to render our app there: 

~~~html title="src/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>dhtmlxOptimus guide</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- Create a container with the unique id -->
		<section id="app" class="main__container"></section>
	</body>
</html>
~~~

2\. Next, we've created an *index.js* file - the entry point of the app. 

~~~js title="src/index.js"
import "./assets/css/index.css"; // import css styles
import { App } from "dhx-optimus";

export class MyApp extends App {}
~~~

Here we've created the MyApp class that renders our application. The MyApp class is inherited from the App class included from the "dhx-optimus" library. 

3\. After that, we've added our first View. For that, we've created the *TopLayout.js* file in the *views* folder. 

{{note We recommend that you use the capital letter at the beginning of the name of the file that have a view => TopLayout.js. This is the common practice.}}

~~~js title="src/views/TopLayout.js"
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return `<h1>Hello Optimus!</h1>`;
	}
}
~~~

As you can see, we've created the TopLayout class that is inherited from the View class included from the "dhx-optimus" library. To create the initial view, we've returned an HTML element in the **init()** method. 

4\. Then, to render the just created view, we've included the view into the *index.js* file and rendered it via the **show()** method:

~~~js title="src/index.js" {4,7-9}
import "./assets/css/index.css";

import { App } from "dhx-optimus";
import { TopLayout } from "./views/TopLayout";

export class MyApp extends App {
	init() {
		this.show(null, TopLayout); 
	}
}
~~~

You can find more details on API methods [below](optimus_guides.md#api).

5\. Finally, we've initialized our application via updating the code of the *index.html* file with the following:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>dhtmlxOptimus guide</title>
		<!-- Suite -->
		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.dhtmlx.com/suite/edge/suite.js"></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.dhtmlx.com/suite/edge/suite.css" />
		<!-- App -->
		<script type="text/javascript" src="./app.js"></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="./app.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<section id="app" class="main__container"></section>
		<script>
			const app = new optimusguide.MyApp();
			app.render("#app");
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
~~~

Everything is pretty straightforward here:

- we've included a free version of DHTMLX from our CDN. It is necessary to include files of DHTMLX Suite as dependencies for correct work of DHTMLX Optimus;
- we've included the *app.js* and *app.css* files to configure webpack;
- we've initialized the app via the **render()** method that takes the ID of the container as a parameter.

That's all! 

To get acquainted with the principles of developing with DHTMLX Optimus at a professional level, follow our [step-by-step guide](optimus_guides/how_to_start_optimus.md). The guide is suitable for both experienced users and beginners in the world of JavaScript and DHTMLX.


Application structure
--------------

To create a structure of your own app, extend the existing classes. DHTMLX Optimus contains three main classes:

- [App class](#app-class)
- [View class](#view-class)
- [Component class](#component-class)

### App class

The App class is the main class of the application. 

Note, that:

- A new app class is created via extending the App class;
- The **init()** method defines the initial view to show;
- The *show()* method allows rendering the main View of the app

~~~js
import { App } from "dhx-optimus";
import { TopLayout } from "./views/TopLayout";

export class MyApp extends App {
	init() {
		this.show(null, TopLayout);
	}
}
~~~

### View class

View class ia a base class intended to create and hierarchically arrange different visual components, to add widgets of Suite, and also to pass data to child components. 

To create an application of the desired structure you need to be able to connect different views and set hierarchy of components on a page.

Note, that:

- A new view class is inherited from the View class;
- The **init()** method returns a View either as an HTML element or as a DHTMLX widget;
- The **ready()** method allows you to create the necessary logic after rendering the View to the DOM and to get an HTML container of the rendered View as a parameter of the method
- The **destroy()** method allows you to destroy your own views. DHTMLX Optimus destroys views automatically. The method can be useful for destroying the parts of your own logic.

Here are some examples:

- the example of the View returned as an HTML element:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return `<h1>Hello Optimus!</h1>`;
	}
	ready(root) {
		console.log(`This root container:`, root);
	}
}
~~~

As a result, the parent container of the View will be returned to the console, as in:

~~~html
<section id="app" class="main__container">
	<h1>Hello Optimus!</h1>
</section>
~~~

- the example of the View returned as a DHTMLX widget:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class DataView extends View {
	init() {
		this.dataView = new dhx.DataView(null, {
			data: this.params.dataCollection,
			itemsInRow: 2,
			gap: 20,
			template: ({ name, post }) => `
				<div class="personal-card">
					<div class="personal-card__container">
						<h3>${name}</h3>
						<p>${post}</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			`,
		});
		return this.dataView;
	}
}
~~~

The example is pretty simple. We've just initialized the DHTMLX DataView widget and returned it as a view.

- the example of the View returned as a DHTMLX widget that contains several Views:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { DataView } from "./content/DataView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {
			rows: [
				{
					id: "toolbar",
					height: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, ToolbarView),
				},
				{
					id: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, DataView, {
						dataCollection: this.params.persons,
					}),
				},
			],
		});
		return this.layout;
	}
}
~~~

The above sample shows that the DHTMLX Layout component possesses the *init* property. The property allows you to display the View in the specified cell of the layout via the *show()* method in a short form.

You can create any number of Views for your app and render them via the cells of DHTMLX Layout. For more details on API and useful properties of the DHTMLX widgets, see below. 

### Component class

Component class is a service class that intended to create additional logic of the app without its further rendering. A new component class is inherited from the Component class. 

The advantages of the class inherited from the Component class are:

- the ability to use the event bus of the app;
- the ability to exchange data;
- the ability to destroy events automatically.

Let's consider the Component class on the example of DHTMLX Uploader:

~~~js
import { Component } from "dhx-optimus";

export default class Uploader extends Component {
	init() {
		this.uploader = new dhx.Uploader({
			target: this.params.target,
		});
		...
	}
}
~~~

The above code shows that:

- the **init()** method does not return anything;
- we've passed the additional parameter (*this.params.target*) via the parent component.

The Component class also provides access to the events of the app via the **fire()**, **on()** methods. See more details below.


The following example shows that it is possible to use the class inherited from the Component class by calling it in the class inherited from the App class via the [use()](optimus_guides.md#api) method.

~~~js
import { App } from "dhx-optimus";

import TopLayout from "./views/TopLayout";
import Uploader from "./components/Uploader";

export class FileExplorer extends App {
	init() {
		...

		this.show(null, TopLayout, { folders: this.folders });
		this.use(Uploader, { target: "./backend/upload"});

		...
	}
}
~~~


## Subscribing to global events 

Subscribing to a global event allows tracking changes made in a component. You can register an event handler in the global event bus and define a function to be triggered when the event is fired. 

Let's consider an example. We want to display different content in the View, based on the button selected in the toolbar. For that, we will use the global event bus.

To subscribe to the global **viewChange** event, we'll apply the *this.on()* method:

~~~js {24-26}
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { EmptyView } from "./EmptyView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {
			rows: [
				{
					id: "toolbar",
					height: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, ToolbarView),
				},
				{
					id: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, EmptyView),
				},
			],
		}));
	}

	ready() {
		this.on("viewChange", id => {
			this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), EmptyView, { content: id });
		});
	}
}
~~~

The event will change the views via the *this.show()* method.

To call the **viewChange** event, we'll use the *this.fire()* API:

~~~js {35}
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class ToolbarView extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.toolbar = new dhx.Toolbar(null, {
			css: "toolbar",
			data: [
				{
					type: "spacer",
				},
				{
					id: "first",
					value: "First",
					group: "views",
				},
				{
					id: "second",
					value: "Second",
					group: "views",
				},
				{
					id: "third",
					value: "Third",
					group: "views",
				},
				{
					type: "spacer",
				},
			],
		}));
	}

	ready() {
		this.toolbar.events.on("click", id => {
			this.fire("viewChange", [id]);
		});
	}
}
~~~

As you can see, whenever the user clicks the button in the toolbar, the *this.fire()* method will be called and the handler will be executed.

We should also pass the changed state to the child component:  

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class EmptyView extends View {
	init() {
		return `
			<div class="empty__container">
				This is the ${this.params.content || "empty"} view
			</div>`;
	}
}
~~~

Here we are! After clicking the button in the toolbar, the necessary content will be displayed in the View. 

<br/>
The following code sample shows that the global event, defined in the App class, is available from any point of the application:

~~~js
import { App } from "dhx-optimus";
import { TopLayout } from "./views/TopLayout";

export class MyApp extends App {
	init() {
		this.show(null, TopLayout);

		this.on("viewChange", id => {
			console.log("You clicked on:", id);
		});
	}
}
~~~


## Passing data to child components

There is a possibility to pass data from parent components to the child components. It allows configuring the child components within the context of the parent ones or changing configuration of the child depending on the parent's state.

Let's take a look at the code snippet from the previous point:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

...

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		...
	}

	ready() {
		this.on("viewChange", id => {
			this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), EmptyView, { content: id });
		});
	}
}
~~~

We've added an event handler to the **viewChange** event of the global event bus. When the id is changed, the **show(target, view, params)** method is called. The method takes 3 parameters, but we're interested in the last one. It allows passing an object with the necessary parameters. For instance:

~~~js
this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), EmptyView, { content: id });
~~~

It is possible to get this parameter in the child component:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class EmptyView extends View {
	init() {
		return `
			<div class="empty__container">
				This is the ${this.params.content} view
			</div>`;
	}
}
~~~

## Initializing the app's global state

It is also possible to use the App class for exchanging data between the components via initializing *Observable Store* which allows managing the global state of the application. To be able to access the state, you need to create a global store and subscribe to its changes.

Let's consider how you can create a global store, retrieve the state of the store and use it in your app.

{{note The below code example demonstrates the part of the application sample. The full code is available on <a href="https://github.com/DHTMLX/optimus-starter-app/tree/guide/step-3" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. }} 

At first, we've initialized the global state of the app in the App class via creating the global store and subscribing to the changes of the store. To retrieve the current state of the store, we've used the **getState()** method.

~~~js
import { App } from "dhx-optimus";
import Store from "dhx-optimus-store";

import { TopLayout } from "./views/TopLayout";

const initialState = {
	active: "first",
};

export class MyApp extends App {
	init() {
		// create a global store
		this.store = new Store(initialState);
		this.params.store = this.store;
		this.state = this.store.getState();

		this.show(null, TopLayout);

		// subscribe to Store changes
		this.on("viewChange", id => {
			this.state.active = id;
		});
	}
}
~~~

Then, we've used the toolbar component to generate the changes of the state there. The *fire()* method calls the handler each time the user clicks the button in the toolbar: 

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class ToolbarView extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.toolbar = new dhx.Toolbar(null, {...}));
	}

	ready() {
		this.observe(
			state => state.active,
			active => {
				this.toolbar.data.update(active, { active: true });
			}
		);

		this.toolbar.events.on("click", id => {
			this.fire("viewChange", [id]);
		});
	}
}
~~~

The above code implements the following logic:

- each time the user clicks the button in the toolbar, the **viewChange** event is called in the ToolbarView class via the *fire* method;
- the id of the button pressed in the toolbar is passed to the *fire* method;
- the state of the app changes on triggering of the global **viewChange** event in the MyApp class;
- the *active* global state gets the current state of the app via the id of the toolbar button.

Using the **observe** method helps to asynchronously observe the changes made to the global store from any point of the application:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { EmptyView } from "./EmptyView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {...}));
	}

	ready() {
		this.observe(
			state => state.active,
			active => {
			  this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), EmptyView, {content: active});
			}
		);
	}
}
~~~
 
## Working with widgets of Suite

You can easily build your app based on the components of DHTMLX Suite by using Optimus. 

{{note You can create your first app with DHTMLX Optimus with the help of our [step-by-step](optimus_guides/how_to_start_optimus.md) guide.}}

DHTMLX Optimus automatically destroys components and events, so you can not worry about the life cycle of the component. 

The small and fast microframework is intended to build DHTMLX-based apps easier and faster. Thus, you just need to follow the main principles of the work with Optimus that are given below.

### Initialization of the DHTMLX Suite components 

In most cases creating a View based on the component of the Suite library is pretty simple:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class CalendarView extends View {
	init() {
		return new dhx.Calendar(null, {
			value: new Date,
		});
	}
	ready() {
		console.log("Calendar is ready");
	}
	destroy() {
		console.log("Calendar is destroy");
	}
}
~~~

In the above example, we've initialized the view that returns DHTMLX Calendar. 

Let's consider the code in detail:

- the **init()** method returns the configured DHTMLX Calendar;
- the **ready()** method will be called after the View is rendered in a DOM tree. You can implement your own logic and don't be afraid that the component has not been rendered yet;
- the **destroy()** method will be called after the View is deleted from the DOM tree. At this moment, Optimus destroys as the DHTMLX components as events related to the View. You can also describe your own logic here, if needed. 

### Initialization of the DHTMLX Window component 

Creating a view based on DHTMLX Window is similar to creating a View based on the other components of Suite. The only difference is rendering of the View. 

Let's create the view based on DHTMLX Window and then render it in the TopLayout view.

The initialization of the DHTMLX Window component is the same as initialization of the other components:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class WindowView extends View {
	init() {
		return this.window = new dhx.Window({
			title: "DHX Window",
			resizable: true,
			movable: true
		});
	}
	ready() {
		console.log("DHX Window is ready");
	}
	destroy() {
		console.log("DHX Window is destroy");
	}
}
~~~

But rendering of the View based on DHTMLX Window will look like this:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";
...
import { WindowView } from "./WindowView";
...
export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {...}));
	}

	ready() {
		...
		this.show(null, WindowView);
	}
}
~~~

To listen to the changes made to the global state, we should update the code of *WindowView* and apply the **observe()** method.  As a result, the *WindowView* will be rendered when switching to the second page of the app:  

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

export class WindowView extends View {
	init() {
		return this.window = new dhx.Window({ ... });
	}
	ready() {
		console.log("DHX Window is ready");
		this.observe(
			state => state.active,
			active => {
				if (active === "second") {
					this.window.show();
				} else {
					this.window.hide();
				}
			}
		);
	}
	destroy() { ... }
}
~~~

Thus, it is possible to display the DHTMLX Window based View in any necessary View.

### Initialization of the DHTMLX Layout component

Let's consider 3 methods of rendering a View via the **show()** method, one of which implies rendering of the View directly in the DHTMLX Layout component:


1\. It is possible to render views with the help of the **show()** method:

~~~js {20-21}
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { EmptyView } from "./EmptyView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {
			rows: [
				{
					id: "toolbar",
					height: "content",
				},
				{
					id: "content",
				}
			]
		});

		this.show(this.layout.getCell("toolbar"), ToolbarView);
		this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), EmptyView);

		return this.layout;
	}
}
~~~

2\. It is possible to call the **show()** method right in the layout via the *init* option. The option returns the current Layout cell as a parameter. You can use this way when you need to get the static layout without changing the view.

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { EmptyView } from "./EmptyView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return new dhx.Layout(null, {
			rows: [
				{
					id: "toolbar",
					height: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, ToolbarView),
				},
				{
					id: "content",
					init: cell = this.show(cell, EmptyView)
				}
			]
		});
	}
}
~~~

3\. You can also combine the above two methods if you need to change views in the Layout cell:

~~~js
import { View } from "dhx-optimus";

import { ToolbarView } from "./ToolbarView";
import { DataView } from "./content/DataView";
import { ChartView } from "./content/ChartView";
import { GridView } from "./content/GridView";

export class TopLayout extends View {
	init() {
		return (this.layout = new dhx.Layout(null, {
			rows: [
				{
					id: "toolbar",
					height: "content",
					init: cell => this.show(cell, ToolbarView),
				},
				{
					id: "content",
				}
			]
		}));
	}

	ready() {
		this.observe(
			state => state.active,
			active => {
				switch (active) {
					case "first":
						this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), DataView);
						break;
					case "second":
						this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), ChartView);
						break;
					case "third":
						this.show(this.layout.getCell("content"), GridView);
						break;
				}
			}
		);
	}
}
~~~

## API

            <li><b>name</b> - (<i>string</i>) the event name</li>
            </ul>
            </td>

### Methods used inside the classes

- The *App's* constructor provides the following method:

<table>
	<tbody>
         <tr>
			<td><b>init()</b></td>
			<td>mandatory, allows initializing available views and logic of the components. <br>For more details, see the <a href="#app-class">App class</a>.
            </td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

- The <i>Component's</i> constructor provides the following methods:

<table>
	<tbody>
         <tr>
			<td><b>init()</b></td>
			<td>mandatory, allows initializing the logic of the Component. This logic will be called on  initialization of the Component. For more details, see the <a href="#component-class">Component class</a>.
            </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>destroy()</b></td>
			<td>the method is called on destroying the Component
            </td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

- The <i>View's</i> constructor provides the following methods:

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><b>init(): string|DHXWidget</b></td>
			<td>obligatory, allows initializing and returning the view. For more details, see the <a href="#view-class">View class</a>.
            </td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td><b>ready()</b></td>
			<td>allows implementing an additional logic after rendering View to DOM. It takes one parameter:
            <ul>
            <li><b>root</b> - (<i>HTMLElement</i>) returns an HTML element of the parent container of the view </li>
            </ul>
            </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>destroy()</b></td>
			<td>allows implementing an additional logic on destroying the component, and unmounts the View from DOM. In most cases, you don't need to use this method, as the views based on the DHTMLX widgets are destroyed automatically.
            </td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

- The <i>App's</i> constructor also provides the method that can be called outside the application:

<table>
	<tbody>
         <tr>
			<td><b>render()</b></td>
			<td>renders an application inside the specified container. It takes one parameter:
			<ul>
			<li><b>container</b> - (<i>string|cell|HTMLElement</i>) the container where the app will be rendered</li>
            </ul>
            </td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
