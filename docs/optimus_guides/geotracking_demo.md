## Demo overview

The geo tracking demo is a nice and easy solution for business. It is created to check and manage the delivery process in real-time. The Tracking system is integrated with Google Maps and shows the real-time geolocation of couriers. You can visualize the information you need with the help of a Form.

The geo tracking demo is developed on the base of the DHTMLX Optimus framework. The components of the demo are divided into Views. You can initialize or modify each component separately. Any component can be removed. The demo can be taken as a View itself and become a component of another app.

There are no specific backend requirements. The demo is based on the REST API and you can use any backend platform which supports it (PHP, Nodejs, .Net, Java, etc.).
