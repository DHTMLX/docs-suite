# save()

@short: saves changes made in a data collection to the server side

@signature: {'save?: (url: string | IDataProxy) => void;'}

@params:
- `url: string | IDataProxy` - the URL of a server side or DataProxy with the URL configured

@example:
grid.data.save("http://userurl/");

//or
grid.data.save(new DataProxy({url:"http://userurl/"}));

@descr:

Each time the user changes data of the component, the **save()** method will make an AJAX call and expect the remote URL to save data changes.
The method will send one of the following requests to the backend:

- `POST` - after adding new data into the component;
- `PUT` - after editing data of the component;
- `DELETE` - after deleting data.

Data saving is asynchronous, so you need to return a promise - the result of the saving operation. To do this, use the **saveData** property that returns a "promise" object:

~~~js
const data = new DataCollection();
data.save(loader);
return data.saveData.then(function () {
    // now your data is saved
});
~~~

Use the [isSaved](data_collection/api/datacollection_issaved_method.md) method to know whether the changes are saved:

~~~js
grid.data.saveData.then(function () {
	console.log(grid.data.isSaved());
});
~~~

@changelog:
Before v7.2, the method sent the `POST` request to the backend on each change of data. <br>
Starting from v7.2, depending on the user actions (editing, adding, or deleting of data), the method sends different requests (POST, PUT, or DELETE respectively) to the server.
