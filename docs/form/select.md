	rows: [
    	{
        	type: "select",
            name: "select",
        	label: "select",
        	labelWidth: "50px",
        	width:"200px",
        	options: [
        		{
        			value: "1",
        			content: "1",
					disabled: true
        		},
        		{
        			value: "2",
        			content: "2"
        		},
        		{
        			value: "3",
        			content: "3"
        		},
        		{
        			value: "4",
        			content: "4"
        		}
        	]        
        }  
    ]
});
