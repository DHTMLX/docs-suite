- the hour value
- the minutes value
- the "AM/PM" identifier for 12-hour format as a string

2\. The value set as an object:

- for the 24-hour format contains key:value pairs for hours, minutes and their values: <br/>{hour: 0, minute: 39}
- for the 12-hour format contains key:value pairs for for hours, minutes, am/pm identifiers and their values: <br/>{hour: 6, minute: 0, AM: true}

3\. The date set as a number is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC returned by the [getTime()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime)
method of the **Date** object.
