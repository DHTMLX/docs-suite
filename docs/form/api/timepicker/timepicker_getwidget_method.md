It is possible to use methods of DHTMLX TimePicker via the **getWidget()** method of a TimePicker control.

For example, you can set value for a TimePicker control. To do this, you need to get the widget attached to the TimePicker control and then use the [setValue()](timepicker/api/timepicker_setvalue_method.md) method of this widget.

~~~js
const timepicker = form.getItem("timepicker").getWidget();  // -> TimePicker
timepicker.setValue("00:39"); //set the value as a string
~~~
