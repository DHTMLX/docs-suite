# getWidget()

@short: returns the ComboBox widget attached to a Combo control

@signature: {'getWidget(): Combobox;'}

@returns:
An object of the DHTMLX Combo widget.

@example:
const combo = form.getItem("combo").getWidget();  
// -> DHTMLX ComboBox

@descr:

It is possible to use methods of DHTMLX ComboBox via the **getWidget()** method of a Combo control.

For example, you can set focus in the Combo input without opening a popup with options. To do this, you need to get the widget attached to the Combo control and then use the [focus()](combobox/api/combobox_focus_method.md) method of this widget.

~~~js
const combo = form.getItem("combo_id").getWidget();  // -> ComboBox
combo.focus(); // sets focus in the input
~~~
