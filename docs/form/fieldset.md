## Adding Fieldset

You can easily add a Fieldset control during initialization of a form:

~~~js
const form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
	rows: [
	    {
	        type: "fieldset",
	        label: "Section name",
	        name: "f1",
	        disabled: false, 
	        hidden: false, 
	        css: "mycss",
	        rows: [
                {
                    type: "input",
                    name: "name",
                    required: true,
                    label: "Name",
                    placeholder: "Type text",
                },
                {
                    type: "input",
                    name: "surname",
                    required: true,
                    label: "Surname",
                    placeholder: "Type text",
                },
                // more controls
            ]
	    }
	]
});

## Working with Fieldset

You can manipulate a Fieldset control by using methods or events of the object returned by the [getItem()](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method.
