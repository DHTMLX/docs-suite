## Adding Checkbox

You can easily add a Checkbox control during initialization of a form:

~~~js
const form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
    rows: [
		{	
			type: "checkbox",
            label: "I agree",
            name: "agree",
            id: "agree",
            value: "checkboxvalue"
		}
    ]
});
~~~

### Properties

## Working with Checkbox

You can manipulate a Checkbox control by using methods or events of the object returned by the [getItem()](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method.

For example, you can get the value of the control:

~~~js
const value = form.getItem("checkbox").getValue();
