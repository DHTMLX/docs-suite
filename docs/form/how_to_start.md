# Initialization

To add dhtmlxForm into an application, you need to take the following simple steps:

- [Download the Form package](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/download.shtml) and unpack it into a folder of your project
- [Include source files](#include-source-files)
- [Create a container](#create-a-container)
- [Define Form structure](#define-form-structure)
- [Initialize Form](#initialize-form) with the object constructor

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>How to Start with dhtmlxForm</title>         
        <script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="form_container"></div>
        <script>
            // creating dhtmlxForm
            var form = new dhx.Form("form");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

## Include source files

Create an HTML file and place full paths to JS and CSS files of the dhtmlxSuite library into the header of the file. The files are:

- *suite.js*
- *suite.css*

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
~~~

## Create a container

Add a container for the Form and give it an id, e.g. "form_container":

~~~html
<div id="form_container"></div>
~~~

## Define Form structure

Now you need to specify the list of Form controls. For example, you can create a form with two text fields for entering a name and an email, a checkbox for the user to give consent to data processing and a button to 
send a form to a server.

Thus, the structure of your form will look like this:

- a Name input
- an Email input
- an Agree checkbox
- a Send button

To add controls inside a form, you should put them into a layout, either a vertical one (the **rows** attribute), or a horizontal one (the **cols** attribute). In the example below controls are arranged vertically, one under
another:

~~~js
var form_data = {
	rows:[
    	{
      		type: "input",
      		label: "Name",
      		icon: "dxi dxi-magnify",
      		placeholder: "John Doe",
      		name: "name"
    	},
    	{
      		type: "input",
      		label: "Email",
      		placeholder: "jd@mail.name",
      		name: "email"
    	},		
    	{		
      		type: "input",
      		inputType: "password",
      		label: "Password",
      		placeholder: "********",
      		name: "password"
    	},
    	{
      		type: "checkbox",
      		text: "I agree",
      		value: "checkboxvalue",
      		id: "agree",
      		name: "agree"
    	},
    	{
      		type: "button",
      		text: "Send",
      		size: "medium",
      		view: "flat",
      		submit: true,
      		color: "primary"
    	}
	]
};
~~~

## Initialize Form

Initialize Form with the `dhx.Form` object constructor. The constructor takes two parameters:

- the HTML object on the page that serves as the form container. 
- a configuration object which (besides config options) contains an array of form controls defined as objects with a set of attributes 

~~~js
var form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
	css: "dhx_widget--bordered",
	rows: [
		{
			type: "input",
			label: "Name",
			icon: "dxi dxi-magnify",
			placeholder: "John Doe",
			name: "name"
		},
		// more form controls
	]
});
~~~

### Configuration properties
