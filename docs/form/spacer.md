## Adding Spacer

You can easily add a Spacer control during initialization of a form:

~~~js
const form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
    rows: [
        {
  			type: "input",
  			label: "Name",
  			name: "name"
		},
		{
  			type: "spacer",
            name: "spacer"
		},
		{
  			type: "input",
  			label: "Email",
  			name: "email"
		}
    ]
});
~~~
