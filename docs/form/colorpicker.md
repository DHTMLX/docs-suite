## Adding ColorPicker

You can easily add a ColorPicker control during initialization of a form:

~~~js
const form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
    rows: [
		{
			type: "colorpicker",
            name: "colorpicker",
            labelWidth: "200px",
			label: "Choose your color"
		}
    ]
});
~~~

### Properties

View [the full list of configuration properties of the Colorpicker control](form/api/colorpicker/api_colorpicker_properties.md).

## Working with ColorPicker

You can manipulate a ColorPicker control by using methods or events of the object returned by the [getItem()](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method.

For example, you can get the value of the control:

~~~js
const value = form.getItem("colorpicker").getValue();
~~~

### Events

## Working with the dhtmlxColorPicker widget

There is a possibility to use methods of DHTMLX ColorPicker via the [getWidget()](form/api/colorpicker/colorpicker_getwidget_method.md) method of a ColorPicker control.

For example, you can set focus on the specified value in the control. To do this, you need to get the widget attached to the ColorPicker control and then use the [setFocus()](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_setfocus_method.md) method of this widget.

~~~js
const colorpicker = form.getItem("colorpicker").getWidget();  // -> ColorPicker
colorpicker.setFocus("#BDF0E9"); // sets focus on the "#BDF0E9" color
~~~
