The Container control is a very convenient way to develop Form-based solutions. You can improve your project with HTML code or combine several native widgets in one Form to make the project functional and easy to use. You cannot attach Layout and Form widgets.

## How to start

You can add the Container control to the Form in an easy way.

You need to specify the type of the control `type: "container"` during the initialization of Form and then use one of the methods:

- [](form/api/container/container_attachhtml_method.md) - for HTML code
- [](form/api/container/container_attach_method.md) - for DHTMLX widget

You can also attach the HTML code directly to the Container control. Look at the sample above.

## Methods

## Events
