The Container control is a very convenient way to develop Form-based solutions. You can improve your project with HTML code or combine several native widgets in one Form to make the project functional and easy to use.

:::note
You cannot attach Layout and Form widgets.

## How to start

You can add the Container control to the Form in an easy way.

You need to specify the type of the control `type: "container"` during the initialization of Form and then use one of the methods:

- [](form/api/container/container_attachhtml_method.md) - for HTML code
- [](form/api/container/container_attach_method.md) - for DHTMLX widget

You can also attach the HTML code directly to the Container control. Look at the sample above.

## Methods
