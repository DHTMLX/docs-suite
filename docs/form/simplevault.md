## Adding SimpleVault

You can easily add a SimpleVault control during initialization of a form:

~~~js
const form = new dhx.Form("form_container", {
	rows: [
    	{
			type: "simpleVault",
			name:"simplevault",
			label: "i am simpleVault",
			labelWidth: "120px",
			labelPosition: "left",
			disabled: false,
			required: false
		}
    ]
});
~~~

### Properties

View [the full list of configuration properties of the SimpleVault control](form/api/simplevault/api_simplevault_properties.md).

## Working with SimpleVault

You can manipulate a SimpleVault control by using methods or events of the object returned by the [getItem()](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method.

For example, you can get the value of the control:

~~~js
const value = form.getItem("simpleVault").getValue();
~~~

### Methods

Check [the full list of methods of the SimpleVault control](form/api/api_overview.md#simple-vault-methods).

### Events

Check [the full list of events of the SimpleVault control](form/api/api_overview.md#simple-vault-events).

## Using DataCollection API

You can manipulate a SimpleVault control with the help of the [DataCollection API](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/vault/api__refs__data_methods.html).

For example, you can remove one or all files from the list. To do that, you need to apply the [remove](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/vault/api__data__remove.html), or [removeAll](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/vault/api__data__removeall.html) method of DataCollection to the object returned by the [getItem()](form/api/form_getitem_method.md) method as follows:

~~~js
form.getItem("simpleVault").data.remove("file_id");

form.getItem("simpleVault").data.removeAll();
~~~

## Uploading files

You can read about uploading files into a SimpleVault control in the [related article](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/vault/uploading_files.html).
