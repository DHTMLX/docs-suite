## How to create DHTMLX-based web applications

Here you can find best practices in working with DHTMLX Suite widgets and explore live demo applications to kickstart your project.

### Optimus micro-framework

[Optimus](/optimus_guides/) acts as a facilitator of web development based on DHTMLX Suite. It helps to assemble and reuse widgets within a web app and ensures communication between widgets and the environment.

### Live demo apps

A gallery of live demos provides real-life examples of using DHTMLX widgets in web apps. You can download any demo, view the source code, and try it out in your project. All demos are created with the help of Suite and Optimus.

- [File manager demo](optimus_guides/filemanager_demo)
- [UI dashboard demo](optimus_guides/dashboard_demo)
- [Hotel management demo](optimus_guides/hotel_demo)
- [Geo tracking demo](optimus_guides/geotracking_demo)
- [Sales KPI tracking demo](optimus_guides/kpi_demo)
- [Hospital management demo](optimus_guides/hospital_demo)
- [Online exam demo](optimus_guides/exam_demo)

### CSS widget templates

A [set of CSS templates](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/how-to-create-javascript-applications/) is specially designed for various use cases that can be implemented using DHTMLX widgets. You can borrow the CSS code and apply the styles you like in your web app.
