# beforeColumnDrop

{{pronote This functionality requires PRO version of the DHTMLX Grid (or DHTMLX Suite) package.}}

@short: fires before the user has finished dragging and released the mouse button over a target column

@signature: {'beforeColumnDrop: (data: object, events: MouseEvent) => void | boolean;'}

@params:
- `data: object` - data object. It contains the following parameters:
	- `start: string | number` - the id of a column, from which the dragging process has started
	- `source: array` - an array with ids of dragged columns
	- `target: string | number` - the id of a potential target column
- `events: MouseEvent` - a native HTML event object

@returns:
Return `false` to block the default action; otherwise, `true`.

@example:
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid", {
    columns: [
        { width: 200, id: "country", header: [{ text: "Country" }] },
        { width: 150, id: "population", header: [{ text: "Population" }] },
        { width: 150, id: "age", header: [{ text: "Med. Age" }], draggable: false },
		{ width: 150, id: "density", header: [{ text: "Density (P/KmÂ²)" }] },
    ],
    data: dataset,
    dragItem: "column",
});

grid.events.on("beforeColumnDrop", ({ target }) => target !== "population");
