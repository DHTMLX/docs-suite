# group

@short: Optional. Enables and allows configuring of grouping in Grid columns

:::tip pro version only
The described functionality requires PRO version of the DHTMLX Grid (or DHTMLX Suite) package.
:::

:::note
Note that when you initialize Grid with the `group` configuration property, the tree-like mode is enabled for Grid and it will have `type: tree` property in its configuration.
:::

## Usage

~~~jsx
group?: boolean | IGroup; // false by default
~~~

## Parameters

As an object the `group` configuration option has the following properties:

~~~jsx
group?: {
    panel?: boolean; // true by default
    panelHeight: number; // 40 by default
    hideableColumns?: boolean; // true by default
    showMissed?: boolean | string; // true by default
    fields?: { [colId: string]: IGroupOrder };
    order?: IGroupOrderItem[];
    column?: string | ICol;
}
~~~

:::tip
You can find the detailed description of the `group` object properties with examples in the related guide [Grouping data](grid/usage.md#grouping-data). 
:::

- `panel` - enables the panel of grouping control. When the `panel` config is set to *true*, a user can drag columns' headers to the panel of creating and modifying groups
- `panelHeight` - defines the height of a group in pixels, which allows adjusting the space for rendering a group of columns
- `hideableColumns` - specifies whether columns will be hidden on a group creation. If `hideableColumns` is set to *false*, columns used for grouping will remain visible
- `showMissed` - controls visibility of the elements that don't suit the grouping criteria (e.g. data without values). Has the following settings:
	- when set to *true*, the elements that don't have values for grouping are rendered row by row after all the data
	- if a *string* value is set, e.g. "Missed", values for grouping are rendered as a separate group the name of which will have the specified string value
	- if set to *false*, strings that don't suit the grouping criteria won't be rendered
- `fields` - predefines an extended configuration for data grouping by certain columns, by setting the rules of aggregation and rendering of the results. The attributes of the `fields` object correspond to the ids of columns the aggregation and the order of results are being configured for.
- `order` - defines the order of grouping by setting the sequence of columns for grouping. The `order` array can have the following elements:
strings (columns' ids), or functions that set the values for grouping.
	 - *columns' ids* to group data by in the order of their succession. Grouping starts from the first specified column and will continue for each following one
	 - *callback functions* that take the current data row and return the value for grouping
	 - a *configuration object* as an element that defines the grouping order
	 - a *combination of columns' ids, functions and configuration objects*. Such an approach provides a flexible control over the grouping order by applying static values for some columns and dynamic values calculated by a function for other columns
- `column` - defines the configuration of a column that renders values by the grouped data. This column will be used as a main one for structuring and rendering data grouped by value


@example:
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container", {
    columns: [
        { id: "country", header: [{ text: "Country" }], groupable: true },
        { id: "population", header: [{ text: "Population" }] },
        { id: "area", header: [{ text: "Land Area (KmÂ²)" }] }
    ],
    group: {
        panel: true
    },
    data: dataset
});
