# group

@short: Optional. Enables and allows configuring of grouping in Grid columns

:::tip pro version only
The described functionality requires PRO version of the DHTMLX Grid (or DHTMLX Suite) package.
:::

:::note
Note that when you initialize Grid with the `group` configuration property, the tree-like mode is enabled for Grid and it will have `type: tree` property in its configuration.

## Usage

~~~jsx {22}
type TAggregate = "sum" | "count" | "min" | "max" | "avg" | string;

interface IGroupOrder {
    map?: { [field: string]: [string, TAggregate] | ((row: IRow[]) => string | number) };
    summary?: "top" | "bottom";
}

type IGroupOrderItem = string | IGroupOrder | ((row: IRow) => string);

interface IGroup {
    panel?: boolean; // true by default
    panelHeight: number; // 40 by default
    hideableColumns?: boolean; // true by default
    showMissed?: boolean | string; // true by default
    fields?: { [colId: string]: IGroupOrder };
    order?: IGroupOrderItem[];
    column?: string | ICol;
}

interface IGridConfig {
    ...
    group?: boolean | IGroup;
    ...
}

## Parameters 

As an object the `group` configuration option has the following properties:

:::tip
You can find the detailed description of the `group` object properties with examples in the related guide [Grouping data](grid/usage.md#configuring-data-grouping). 
:::

- `panel` -  (optional) enables the panel of grouping control, *true* by default. When the `panel` config is set to *true*, a user can drag columns' headers to the panel of creating and modifying groups
- `panelHeight` - (optional) defines the height of a group in pixels, which allows adjusting the space for rendering a group of columns, *40* by default
- `hideableColumns` - (optional) specifies whether columns will be hidden on a group creation, *true* by default. If set to *false*, columns used for grouping will remain visible
- `showMissed` - (optional) controls visibility of the elements that don't suit the grouping criteria (e.g. data without values), *true* by default
- `fields` - (optional) predefines an extended configuration for data grouping by certain columns, by setting the rules of aggregation and rendering of the results. The attributes of the `fields` object correspond to the ids of columns for which the aggregation and the order of results are being configured. The configuration of a column is defined by the `IGroupOrder` object that has the following properties:
    - `map` - (optional) an object for data aggregation in a group, where keys are field names, and the values can be:
        - a tuple `[string, TAggregate]` that specifies the field and the aggregation type ("sum", "count", "min", "max", "avg") from the `dhx.methods` helper
        - a user-defined aggregation function `((row: IRow[]) => string | number)`
    - `summary` - (optional) specifies where the total row is rendered - at the `top` or at the `bottom` of the group
- `order` - (optional) defines the order of grouping by setting the sequence of columns for grouping. The elements of the `order` array can be: 
    - a string that represents a grouping field
    - a function of the `((row: IRow) => string)` type for dynamic defining of a group
    - the `IGroupOrder` object that has the following properties:
        - `map` - (optional) an object for data aggregation in a group, where keys are field names, and the values can be:
            - a tuple `[string, TAggregate]` that specifies the field and the aggregation type ("sum", "count", "min", "max", "avg") from the `dhx.methods` helper
            - a user-defined aggregation function `((row: IRow[]) => string | number)`
        - `summary` - (optional) specifies where the total row is rendered - at the `top` or at the `bottom` of the group 
- `column` - (optional) defines the configuration of a column that renders values by the grouped data. This column will be used as a main one for structuring and rendering data grouped by value

@example:
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container", {
    columns: [
        { id: "country", header: [{ text: "Country" }], groupable: true },
        { id: "population", header: [{ text: "Population" }] },
        { id: "area", header: [{ text: "Land Area (KmÂ²)" }] }
    ],
    group: {
        panel: true
    },
    data: dataset
});
