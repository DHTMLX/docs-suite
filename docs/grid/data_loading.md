# Data loading

There are several ways of loading data into DHTMLX Grid:

- on initialization of Grid
- after initialization of Grid

First, you need to prepare a data set that will be loaded into Grid.

## Preparing data set

DHTMLX Grid expects loaded data in the JSON format. Here is an example of an appropriate data set:

~~~js
const dataset = [
    {
        "id": 0,
        "a": 1,
        "b": "Linwood Long long long",
        "c": "Petersen",
        "d": "Dahlgreen Place"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "a": 2,
        "b": "Edenburg",
        "c": "Agnes",
        "d": "Gem Street"
    },
    // more columns
];
~~~

Each object in the data set contains configuration of a grid row. The structure of a row is rather flexible. It may include:

<table>
	<tbody>
        <tr>
			<td><b>id</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string|number</i>) optional, the id of a row. In case you haven't specified ids of rows, they will be auto-generated</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td><b>columnContent</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string|number</i>) content of a column as <i>key:value</i> pairs, where key is the id of a column and value is any content you want to add into the column</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Loading data on initialization

You can load a [predefined data set](#preparing-data-set) into Grid on the initialization stage. Use the [data](grid/api/grid_data_config.md) configuration property, as in:

~~~js
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container", {
    columns: [
        // columns config
    ],
    data: dataset
});
~~~

## Loading data after initialization

There are two ways to load data into Grid after its initialization:

- [from an external file](#external-data-loading)
- [from a local data source](#loading-from-local-source)

### External data loading

To load data from an external file, make use of the **load()** method of [Data Collection](data_collection.md). It takes the URL of the file with data as a parameter:

~~~js
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container");
grid.data.load("../common/dataset.json");
~~~

**Related sample**: [Grid. Initialization with data.load()](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/svkb27d5)

The component will make an AJAX call and expect the remote URL to provide valid JSON data.

Data loading is asynchronous, so you need to wrap any after-loading code into a promise:

~~~js
grid.data.load("/some/data").then(function(){
   // some logic here
});
~~~

### Loading from local source

To load data from a local data source, use the **parse()** method of [Data Collection](data_collection.md). Pass [a predefined data set](#preparing-data-set) as a parameter of this method:

~~~js
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container");
grid.data.parse(dataset);
~~~

**Related sample**: [Grid. Initialization with data.parse()](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/pwzie5wz)

## Saving and restoring state

To save the current state of a grid, use the **serialize()** method of [Data Collection](data_collection.md). It converts the data of a grid into an array of JSON objects.
Each JSON object contains the configuration of a separate row.

~~~js
const state = grid1.data.serialize();
~~~

Then you can parse the data stored in the saved state array to a different grid. For example:

~~~js
// creating a new grid
const grid2 = new dhx.Grid(document.body);
// parsing the state of grid1 into grid2
grid2.data.parse(state);
~~~

## Dynamic loading

{{pronote This functionality requires PRO version of the DHTMLX Grid (or DHTMLX Suite) package.}}
To enable dynamic data loading in Grid you need to:

- initialize **lazyDataProxy** as described in the [Dynamic Loading](helpers/lazydataproxy.md) article

~~~js
new dhx.LazyDataProxy("https://docs.dhtmlx.com/suite/backend/lazyload", {
    limit: 30,
    prepare: 5,
    delay: 150,
    from: 0
});
~~~

- load data into Grid via the **load()** method of Data Collection and pass `lazyDataProxy` as a parameter of this method:

~~~js
const grid = new dhx.Grid("grid_container");
grid.data.load(lazyDataProxy);
~~~

**Related sample**: [External data lazy load](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/grid_lazy_loading)

{{note The **add**, **remove**, **copy**, **move**, **update**, **changeId**, **sort** and **filter** methods of Data Collection will not work until all data are loaded into Grid.}}
