# dropBehaviour

@short: Optional. Defines the behaviour of a dragged item

@signature: {'dropBehaviour?: "child" | "sibling" | "complex";'}

@example:
const source = new dhx.Tree("tree-source",{dragMode:"source", dropBehaviour:"complex"});
const target = new dhx.Tree("tree-target",{dragMode:"target", dropBehaviour:"complex"});

@descr:

**Related sample**: [Tree. Drop behaviour](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/80mh3hly)

{{note Don't forget to enable drag-n-drop via the [](tree/api/tree_dragmode_config.md) property to use dropBehaviour.}}

There are three modes of behaviour of a dragged tree item, depending on the value set for the **dropBehaviour** option in the configuration object of a tree:

- "child" - a dragged item becomes a child of the item it is dragged to

- "sibling" - a dragged item becomes a sibling of the item it is dragged to

- "complex" - a dragged item can become both a child or a sibling of a target item, depending on the position specified by highlighting (check the above images)
