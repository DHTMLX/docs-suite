# Work with Selection object

You can manipulate with Tree items via the API of the **selection** object. It is possible to select an item, remove selection, and get the id or even the object of a selected Tree item.

## Enabling/Disabling Selection object

Starting from v7.0, you can activate selection of items via the [](../selection/api/selection_enable_method.md) method of the selection object.

~~~js
tree.selection.enable();
~~~

To disable selection of items in Tree, make use of the [](../selection/api/selection_disable_method.md) method of the selection object:

~~~js
tree.selection.disable();
~~~

**Related sample**: [Tree. Disable / enable selection](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/g6cmggqt)

{{note To make the process of working with the selection of items more flexible, you can apply the [related](selection.md#events) events of the Selection object.}}

## Selecting an item

To select a particular Tree item, make use of the **add()** method of the **selection** object. As a parameter the method takes the id of an item. 

~~~js
const id = tree.selection.getId(); // -> "2"
tree.selection.add("2");
~~~

## Unselecting an item

To remove selection from a selected item, apply the **remove()** method of the **selection** object. The method may take the id of an item as a parameter:

~~~js
tree.selection.remove("2"); 
~~~

Starting from v7.0, the method unselects all previously selected items when calling without parameters:

~~~js
tree.selection.remove();
~~~

## Getting id of a selected item

You can get the id of the currently selected item with the **getId()** method of the **selection** object:

~~~js
const selected = tree.selection.getId(); // -> "2"
~~~

## Getting object of a selected item

It is also possible to get the object of a selected item using the **getItem()** method of the **selection** object:

~~~js
const item = tree.selection.getItem();
~~~
