# Initialization

:::info
[Download the DHTMLX Popup package](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/download.shtml) as a part of the DHTMLX Suite library
:::

To add DHTMLX Popup into an application, you need to take the following simple steps:

- [Include source files](#include-source-files)
- [Initialize Popup](#initialize-popup) with the object constructor
- [Set content into Popup](#set-content)

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>How to Start with DHTMLX Popup</title>         
        <script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
    </head>
    <body>       
        <script>
            // creating DHTMLX Popup
            const popup = new dhx.Popup();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

## Include source files

Unpack the downloaded package into a folder of your project.

After that, create an HTML file and place full paths to JS and CSS files of the dhtmlxSuite library into the header of the file. The files are:

- *suite.js*
- *suite.css*

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
~~~

## Initialize Popup

Initialize Popup with the `dhx.Popup` object constructor. 

~~~js
<div id="popup_container"></div>
~~~

~~~js
// creating DHTMLX Popup
const popup = new dhx.Popup();

popup.show("popup_container");
~~~

To show a created popup on a page, you should call the [](popup/api/popup_show_method.md) method after initialization of the component.

### Set content

There are several ways of adding content into DHTMLX Popup:

- by using [attachHTML()](popup/api/popup_attachhtml_method.md) to attach some HTML content into a popup

- by calling [attach()](popup/api/popup_attach_method.md) to add other DHTMLX components into a popup
