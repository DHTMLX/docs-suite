# Data loading

There are several simple ways of loading data into DHTMLX TreeGrid:

- on initialization of TreeGrid
- after initialization of TreeGrid

First, you need to prepare a data set that will be loaded into TreeGrid.

## Preparing data set

DHTMLX TreeGrid expects loaded data in the JSON format. Here is an example of an appropriate data set:

~~~js
const dataset = [
    {
        "id": 0,
        "a": 1,
        "b": "Linwood Long long long",
        "c": "Petersen",
        "d": "Dahlgreen Place"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "parent": 0,
        "a": 2,
        "b": "Edenburg",
        "c": "Agnes",
        "d": "Gem Street"
    },
    // more columns
];
~~~

Each object in the data set contains configuration of a grid row. The structure of a row is rather flexible. It may include:

<table>
	<tbody>
        <tr>
			<td><b>rowId</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string|number</i>) optional, the id of a row. In case you haven't specified ids of rows, they will be auto-generated</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td><b>parent</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string|number</i>) the ID of the parent row</td>
		</tr>
        <tr>
			<td><b>columnContent</b></td>
			<td>(<i>string|number</i>) content of a column as <i>key:value</i> pairs, where key is the id of a column and value is any content you want to add into the column</td>
		</tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Loading data on TreeGrid initialization

You can specify data you want to load into TreeGrid on the initialization stage. Make use of the [data](treegrid/api/treegrid_data_config.md) configuration property, as in:

~~~js
const treegrid = new dhx.TreeGrid("treegrid_container", {
    columns: [
        // columns config
    ],
    data: dataset
});
~~~

## Loading data after initialization

There are two ways to load data into TreeGrid after its initialization:

- [from a local data source](#loading-from-local-source)
- [from an external file](#external-data-loading)

### Loading from local source

To load data from a local data source, use the **parse** method of Tree Collection. Pass [a predefined data set](#preparing-data-set) as a parameter of this method:

~~~js
const treegrid = new dhx.TreeGrid("treegrid_container", {
    columns: [
        // columns config
    ]
});
treegrid.data.parse(dataset);
~~~

**Related sample**: [TreeGrid. Initialization with data.parse()](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/jc8gn40c)

### External data loading

To load data from an external file, make use of the **load** method of Tree Collection. It takes the URL of the file with data as a parameter:

~~~js
const treegrid = new dhx.TreeGrid("treegrid_container", {
    columns: [
        // columns config
    ]
});
treegrid.data.load("../common/dataset.json");
~~~

**Related sample**: [TreeGrid. Initialization with data.load()](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/44rmxlmq)

The component will make an AJAX call and expect the remote URL to provide valid JSON data.

Data loading is asynchronous, so you need to wrap any after-loading code into a promise:

~~~js
treegrid.data.load("/some/data").then(function(){
   // some logic here
});
~~~

## Saving and restoring state

To save the current state of a treegrid, use the **serialize** method of Tree Collection. It converts the data of a treegrid into an array of JSON objects. 
Each JSON object contains the configuration of a separate row.

~~~js
const state = treegrid1.data.serialize();
~~~

Then you can parse the data stored in the saved state array to a different treegrid. For example:

~~~js
// creating a new treegrid
const treegrid2 = new dhx.TreeGrid("treegrid_container2");
// parsing the state of treegrid1 into treegrid2
treegrid2.data.parse(state);
~~~
