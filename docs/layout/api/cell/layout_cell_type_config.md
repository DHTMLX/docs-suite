# type

@signature: {'type?: "line" | "wide" | "space" | "none";'}

@example:
const layout = new dhx.Layout("layout_container", {
    rows: [
        {
            type: "wide", // "line" | "wide" | "space" | "none"
            cols: [
                {
                    html: "1",
                },
                {
                    html: "2",
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            type: "line",
            cols: [
                {
                    html: "3",
                },
                {
                    html: "4",
                },
            ]
        }
