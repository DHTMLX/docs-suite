# Initialization

:::info
[Download the DHTMLX TimePicker package](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxSuite/download.shtml) as a part of the DHTMLX Suite library
:::

To initialize DHTMLX TimePicker on a page, you need to take the following simple steps:

- [Include source files](#include-source-files)
- [Create a container](#create-container)
- [Initialize TimePicker](#initialize-timepicker) with the object constructor
- [Set initial value (optional)](#set-initial-value-optional)

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>How to Start with DHTMLX TimePicker</title>         
        <script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="timepicker_container"></div>
        <script>
            // creating DHTMLX TimePicker 
            const timepicker = new dhx.Timepicker("timepicker_container", {
				// config options
			});
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
~~~

## Include source files

Unpack the downloaded package into a folder of your project.

After that, create an HTML file and place full paths to JS and CSS files of the dhtmlxSuite library into the header of the file. The files are:

- *suite.js*
- *suite.css*

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="../../codebase/suite.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../codebase/suite.css">
~~~

## Create container

Add a container for TimePicker and give it an id, for example "timepicker_container":

~~~html title="index.html"
<div id="timepicker_container"></div>
~~~

## Initialize TimePicker

Initialize TimePicker with the **`dhx.Timepicker`** object constructor. The constructor has two parameters:

- the HTML container for TimePicker,
- optional, an object with [configuration properties](#configuration-properties). If this argument is not passed to the constructor, the settings will be default.

~~~js title="index.js"
// creating DHTMLX TimePicker
const timepicker = new dhx.Timepicker("timepicker_container", {
    // config options
});
~~~

### Configuration properties

There is a set of properties you can specify for TimePicker to optimize its configuration for your needs. 

The detailed information on TimePicker configuration options can be found in the [TimePicker API overview](timepicker/api/api_overview.md#properties) article.

## Set initial value (optional)

You can set initial value for TimePicker before initialization of the component via the [value](timepicker/api/timepicker_value_config.md) configuration option:

~~~js {4}
const timepicker = new dhx.Timepicker("timepicker_container", {
    controls: true,
    css: "dhx_widget--bordered",
    value: new Date,
});
~~~

If you need to set a specific value after initialization of TimePicker, use the [setValue()](timepicker/api/timepicker_setvalue_method.md) method:

~~~js
// set the value as a string
timepicker.setValue("00:39");
// set the value as a Date object
timepicker.setValue(new Date('January 10, 2019 17:54:00'));
// set the value as an array
timepicker.setValue([6,20,"AM"]);
~~~
