# Customization

## Styling

There is a possibility to make changes in the look and feel of a timepicker. 

![Styling Timepicker](../assets/timepicker/custom_style.png)

**Related sample**: [Timepicker. Styling (custom CSS)](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/n4xfu4e9)

For this you need to take the following steps:

- add a new CSS class(es) with desired settings in the &lt;style&gt; section of your HTML page or in your file with styles (don't forget to include your file on the page in this case)

~~~html
<style>
	.my-first-class {
		/*some styles*/
	}
    
    .my-second-class {
		/*some styles*/
	}
</style>
~~~

- specify the name of the created CSS class (or names of classes separated by spaces) as the value of the [css](timepicker/api/timepicker_css_config.md) property in the TimePicker configuration:

~~~js
const timepicker = new dhx.Timepicker("timepicker_container", { 
    css:"my-first-class my-second-class"
});
~~~

For example:

~~~html
<style>
  .custom {
    --dhx-font-color-primary: #c00;
    --dhx-color-primary: #ff5c5c;
  }
</style>

<script>
	const timepicker = new dhx.Timepicker("timepicker_container", {
  		css: "custom dhx_widget--bordered"
	});
</script>
~~~
