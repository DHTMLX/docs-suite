# Localization

DHTMLX Colorpicker allows you to apply different languages to its interface. You just need to translate the corresponding strings for Colorpicker labels and tooltips and apply a ready locale to the component.

## Default locale

The default locale for Colorpicker looks like this:

~~~js
const en = {
	cancel: "Cancel",
	select: "Select",
	rightClickToDelete: "Right click to delete",
	customColors: "Custom colors",
	addNewColor: "Add new color"
};
~~~

## Custom locale

To use a different locale, your need to:

- define necessary language settings: provide translations for the labels of colors' elements in all available formats as well as for the buttons:

~~~js
const de = {
	cancel: "Abbrechen",
	select: "Wählen",
	rightClickToDelete: "Rechtsklick zu entfernen",
	customColors: "Seine Farben",
	addNewColor: "Neue Farbe hinzufügen"
}
~~~

- apply the language settings by calling the **dhx.i18n.setLocale()** method before Colorpicker initialization:

~~~js
dhx.i18n.setLocale("colorpicker_container", de);
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container");
~~~
