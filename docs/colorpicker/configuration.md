# Configuration

## Custom colors in palette

The palette of Colorpicker contains a set of default colors. They are enumerated below:

~~~js
const palette = [
    ["#D4DAE4","#B0B8CD","#949DB1","#727A8C","#5E6677","#3F4757","#1D2534"],
    ["#FFCDD2","#FE9998","#F35C4E","#E94633","#D73C2D","#CA3626","#BB2B1A"],
    ["#F9E6AD","#F4D679","#EDB90F","#EAA100","#EA8F00","#EA7E00","#EA5D00"],
    ["#BCE4CE","#90D2AF","#33B579","#36955F","#247346","#1D5B38","#17492D"],
    ["#BDF0E9","#92E7DC","#02D7C5","#11B3A5","#018B80","#026B60","#024F43"],
    ["#B3E5FC","#81D4FA","#29B6F6","#039BE5","#0288D1","#0277BD","#01579B"],

    ["#C5C0DA","#9F97C1","#7E6BAD","#584A8F","#4F4083","#473776","#3A265F"],
    ["#D6BDCC","#C492AC","#A9537C","#963A64","#81355A","#6E3051","#4C2640"],

];

**Related sample**: [Colorpicker. Initialization](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/ezk8rk4m)

It is possible to redefine the structure of a palette via the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_palette_config.md) config option, and set an array of custom colors that will be shown on initialization of the component. 
For example:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
    // removes the section with gray shades shown at the top of palette by default
    grayShades: false,
    palette: [
        ["#ffffc0", "#ffff9c", "#ecd078", "#a59154", "#5e5330"],
        ["#ff916b", "#ff7657", "#d95b43", "#973f2e", "#56241a"],
        ["#ff4169", "#f93555", "#c02942", "#861c2e", "#4c101a"],
        ["#863958", "#6d2e47", "#542437", "#3a1926", "#210e16"],
        ["#84bec3", "#6b9a9e", "#53777a", "#3a5355", "#212f30"]
    ]
});
~~~

## Gray shades

The default configuration of the Colorpicker palette includes a section with gray shades, which is shown at the top of palette. There is a possibility to hide this section showing just main colors: default or custom.

![](../assets/colorpicker/no_shades_palette.png)

**Related sample**: [Colorpicker. Palette without gray shades](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/b44fp8q2)

Use the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_grayshades_config.md) configuration option for this purpose:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
	grayShades: false
});
~~~

## List of custom colors

![](../assets/colorpicker/custom_colors.png)

When Colorpicker is rendered on a page, its list of custom (user-defined) colors is empty. You can change this configuration and specify custom colors that should be shown in the related section on initialization of 
the component via the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_customcolors_config.md) configuration option. Colors should be specified as an array of strings in the Hex format:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
	customColors: ["#1d2de7", "#ab31ff", "#a3fa76"]
});
~~~

## "palette" or "picker" mode only

DHTMLX Colorpicker has two main modes: "palette" (default) and "picker". To initialize the component in the "picker" mode, set the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_pickeronly_config.md) property in the Colorpicker 
configuration to *true*.

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
	pickerOnly: true
});
~~~

In this mode the palette is not available and only the picker is displayed.

![](../assets/colorpicker/picker_only.png)

**Related sample**: [Colorpicker. Picker only](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/5zlvvwpl)

It is also possible to create the component in the palette mode only using the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_paletteonly_config.md) mode:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
	paletteOnly: true
});
~~~

![](../assets/colorpicker/palette_only.png)

{{note Note that in the **paletteOnly** mode the palette is displayed without the panel with custom (user-defined) colors.}}

## Width of Colorpicker

By default, the width of the component is 238 px. In case you change the number of colors in the palette, it may be necessary to adjust the width of Colorpicker accordingly. You can do this with the help of the [](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_width_config.md) property:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {  
    width: "300px"              
});
~~~
