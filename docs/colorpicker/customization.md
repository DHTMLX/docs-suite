# Customization

## Styling

There is a possibility to make changes in the look and feel of a colorpicker.

**Related sample**: [Colorpicker. Styling (custom CSS)](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/mnwi3sp0)

For this you need to take the following steps:

- add a new CSS class(es) with desired settings in the &lt;style&gt; section of your HTML page or in your file with styles (don't forget to include your file on the page in this case)

~~~html
<style>
	.my-first-class {
		/*some styles*/
	}
    
    .my-second-class {
		/*some styles*/
	}
</style>
~~~

- specify the name of the created CSS class (or names of classes separated by spaces) as the value of the [css](colorpicker/api/colorpicker_css_config.md) property in the Colorpicker configuration:

~~~js
const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
    css:"my-first-class my-second-class"
});
~~~

For instance:

~~~html
<style>
	.custom-class {
		background: #f2f2f2;
		border: solid 1px lightblue;
	}

	.custom-class .dhx_palette__cell {
		border-radius: 50%;
	}

	.custom-class .dhx_palette__cell:after {
		border-radius: 50%;
	}

	.custom-class .dhx_colorpicker-custom-colors__picker {
		border-radius: 50%;
	}
</style>

<script>
	const colorpicker = new dhx.Colorpicker("colorpicker_container", {
		css: "custom-class dhx_widget--bordered",
	});
</script>
~~~
