# beforeSelect

@short: fires on selecting an item, but before the item is really selected

@signature: {'beforeSelect: (id: string | number) => void | boolean;'}

@params:
- `id: string | number` - the id of an item

@returns:
Return `false` to prevent selecting of an item; otherwise, `true`.

@example:
component.selection.events.on("beforeSelect", function(id) {
    console.log(id);
    return false;
});

@descr:

{{note The event can be applied to the [DataView](dataview/usage_selection.md), [List](list/usage_selection.md), [Tree](tree/usage_selection.md) components.}}

Starting from v7.0, you can also apply the simplified version of the event:

~~~js
component.events.on("beforeSelect", function(id) {
    console.log(id);
    return false;
});
~~~
