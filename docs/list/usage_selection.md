# Work with Selection object

You can manipulate with List items via the API of the **selection** object. It is possible to select an item, remove selection, and get the id or even the object of a selected List item.

## Enabling/Disabling Selection object

Starting from v7.0, you can activate selection of items via the [](../selection/api/selection_enable_method.md) method of the selection object.

~~~js
list.selection.enable();
~~~

To disable selection of items in List, make use of the [](../selection/api/selection_disable_method.md) method of the selection object:

~~~js
list.selection.disable();
~~~

**Related sample**: [List. Disable / enable selection](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/i4zj985o)

{{note To make the process of working with the selection of items more flexible, you can apply the [related](selection.md#events) events of the Selection object.}}

## Selecting an item

To select a particular List item, make use of the **add()** method of the **selection** object. As a parameter the method takes the id of an item. 

~~~js
const id = list.selection.getId(); // -> "2"
list.selection.add("2");
~~~

**Related sample**: [List. Set selection](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/io8oxxg2)

Starting from v7.0, the method selects all unselected items when calling without parameters:

~~~js
list.selection.add();
~~~

## Unselecting an item

To remove selection from a selected item, apply the **remove()** method of the **selection** object. The method may take the id of an item as a parameter:

~~~js
list.selection.remove("2"); 
~~~

Starting from v7.0, the method unselects all previously selected items when calling without parameters:

~~~js
list.selection.remove();
~~~

## Getting id of a selected item

You can get the id of the currently selected item with the **getId()** method of the **selection** object:

~~~js
const selected = list.selection.getId(); // -> "2"
~~~

**Related sample**: [List. Get selection](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/elonnovx)

Starting from v7.0, the method can also return an array with ids of selected items if the [multiselection](list/api/list_multiselection_config.md) property of List is enabled.

## Getting object of a selected item

It is also possible to get the object of a selected item using the **getItem()** method of the **selection** object:

~~~js
const item = list.selection.getItem();
~~~

Starting from v7.0, the method can also return an array of selected items if the [multiselection](list/api/list_multiselection_config.md) property of List is enabled.
