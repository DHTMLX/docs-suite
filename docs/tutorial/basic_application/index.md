This tutorial describes how to create a basic application  and helps to understand the main principles of working with DHTMLX components. 
It covers a number of issues related to adding components on a page, displaying data on a page, interaction of components with each other.

After you finish this tutorial, you'll have a simple app consisting of:

- a layout that will contain a grid, a toolbar and a chart

- a grid with a list of users and their personal data (first name, last name, email and etc.)

- a chart for displaying the number of vip and default users in percentage terms

- a toolbar for loading users data in the grid and the chart or removing it
