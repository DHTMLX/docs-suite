# dragMode

@short: Optional. Enables drag-n-drop in DataView

@signature: {'dragMode?: "target" | "source" | "both";'}

@example:
const dataview = new dhx.DataView("dataview_container", { 
    dragMode:"source"
});

@descr:

**Related sample**: [Dataview. Drag'n'drop](https://snippet.dhtmlx.com/nia2e5a9)

Drag-n-drop can work in three modes:

- "target" - a dataview takes items from other dataviews, while its items can't be dragged out of it
- "source" - a dataview allows dragging its items out and can't take items from other dataviews
- "both" - a dataview both takes items from other dataviews and allows dragging its items out as well
